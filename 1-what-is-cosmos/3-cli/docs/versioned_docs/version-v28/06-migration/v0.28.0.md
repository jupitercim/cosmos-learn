## Upgrading legacy plugins configuration files

Ignite `v0.28.0` changes the plugin system which is now called Ignite Apps. This version includes changes
to the CLI command names and the plugin configuration file.

The plugins configuration file is now called `igniteapps.yml` and the "plugins" section is now called "apps".

The global plugins directory is now `$HOME/.ignite/apps` instead `$HOME/.ignite/plugins`.

Updates can be automatically applied by running `ignite doctor` in your blockchain application directory.
Running the command outside your blockchain application directory will only update the global plugins.
