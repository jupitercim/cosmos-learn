A full version of the interblockchain protocol has been implemented in Go in the Cosmos SDK [@ibc_cosmos_sdk], an implementation is in progress in Rust [@ibc_rust], and implementations are planned for other languages in the future. An off-ledger relayer daemon has also been implemented in Go [@relayer_go]. Game of Zones [@game_of_zones], a live test of the initial software release, is currently in progress. Over one hundred simulated zones (separate consensus instances and ledgers) have been successfully linked together [@map_of_zones].

Production release and deployment to the Cosmos Network is planned for later this summer. As IBC is a permissionless, opt-in protocol, adoption will be dependent on ledgers voluntarily electing to support the specification, in full or in part. Adoption of IBC does not require connection to the Cosmos Hub, usage of any particular token, or even usage of any other piece of Cosmos software — IBC can be implemented on top of other state machine frameworks such as Substrate [@substrate], or by standalone ledgers using custom logic — adherence to the correct protocol is both necessary and sufficient for successful interoperation.
