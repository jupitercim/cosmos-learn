## Security Model

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

We consider chains that use a proof of stake mechanism based on the model of [weak subjectivity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/) 
in order to strengthen the assumptions required by the underlying consensus engine 
(e.g., [Tendermint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04938.pdf) requires that less than a third of the voting power is Byzantine). 

> **Background**: The next block in a blockchain is *validated* and *voted* upon by a set of pre-determined *full nodes*; these pre-determined full nodes are also known as *validators*. 
We refer to the validators eligible to validate a block as that block's *validator set*. 
To be part of the validator set, a validator needs to *bond* (i.e., lock, stake) an amount of tokens for a (minimum) period of time, known as the *unbonding period*. 
The amount of tokens bonded gives a validator's *voting power*. 
When a validator starts unbonding some of its tokens, its voting power is reduced immediately, 
but the tokens are unbonded (i.e., unlocked) only after the unbonding period has elapsed. 
If a validator misbehaves (e.g., validates two different blocks at the same height), then the system can slash the validator's bonded tokens that gave its voting power during the misbehavior.
This prevents validators from misbehaving and immediately exiting with their tokens, 
i.e., the unbonding period enables the system to punish misbehaving validators after the misbehaviors are committed.
For more details, take a look at the [Tendermint Specification](https://github.com/tendermint/spec/blob/v0.7.1/spec/core/data_structures.md) 
and the [Light Client Specification](https://github.com/tendermint/spec/blob/v0.7.1/spec/light-client/verification/verification_002_draft.md#part-i---tendermint-blockchain).

In the context of CCV, the validator sets of the consumer chains are chosen based on the tokens validators bonded on the provider chain, 
i.e., are chosen from the validator set of the provider chain. 
When validators misbehave on the consumer chains, their tokens bonded on the provider chain are slashed. 
As a result, the security gained from the value of the tokens bonded on the provider chain is shared with the consumer chains. 

Similarly to the single-chain approach, when a validator starts unbonding some of its bonded tokens, its voting power is reduced on all chains (i.e., provider chain and consumer chains); 
yet, due to delays in the communication over the IBC protocol (e.g., due to relaying packets), the voting power is not reduced immediately on the consumer chains. 
A further consequence of CCV is that the tokens are unbonded only after the unbonding period has elapsed on all chains starting from the moment the corresponding voting power was reduced. 
Thus, CCV may delay the unbonding of tokens validators bonded on the provider chain.

## Motivation

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

CCV is a primitive (i.e., a building block) that enables arbitrary shared security models: The security of a chain can be composed of security transferred from multiple provider chains including the chain itself (a consumer chain can be its own provider). As a result, CCV enables chains to borrow security from more established chains (e.g., Cosmos Hub), in order to boost their own security, i.e., increase the cost of attacking their networks. 
> **Intuition**: For example, for chains based on Tendermint consensus, a variety of attacks against the network are possible if an attacker acquire 1/3+ or 2/3+ of all bonded tokens. Since the market cap of newly created chains could be relatively low, an attacker could realistically acquire sufficient tokens to pass these thresholds. As a solution, CCV allows the newly created chains to use validators that have stake on chains with a much larger market cap and, as a result, increase the cost an attacker would have to pay. 

Moreover, CCV enables *hub minimalism*. In a nutshell, hub minimalism entails keeping a hub in the Cosmos network (e.g., the Cosmos Hub) as simple as possible, with as few features as possible in order to decrease the attack surface. CCV enables moving distinct features (e.g., DEX) to independent chains that are validated by the same set of validators as the hub. 

> **Versioning**: Note that CCV will be developed progressively. 
> This standard document specifies the V1 release, which will require the validator set of a consumer chain to be entirely provided by the provider chain. 
> In other words, once a provider chain agrees to provide security to a consumer chain, the entire validator set of the provider chain MUST validate also on the consumer chain.
> 
> For more details on the planned releases, take a look at the [Interchain Security light paper](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/introduction/overview).

## Definition

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

This section defines the new terms and concepts introduced by CCV.

- **Provider Chain**: The blockchain that provides security, i.e., manages the validator set of the consumer chain.

- **Consumer Chain**: The blockchain that consumes security, i.e., enables the provider chain to manage its validator set.

> **Note**: In this specification, the validator set of the consumer chain is entirely provided by the provider chain.

Both the provider and the consumer chains are [application-specific blockchains](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/intro/why-app-specific), 
i.e., each blockchain's state machine is typically connected to the underlying consensus engine via a *blockchain interface*, such as [ABCI](https://github.com/tendermint/spec/tree/v0.7.1/spec/abci). 
The blockchain interface MUST enable the state machine to provide to the underlying consensus engine a set of validator updates, i.e., changes in the voting power granted to validators.
Although this specification is not dependent on ABCI, for ease of presentation, we refer to the state machines as ABCI applications.
Also, this specification considers a modular paradigm, 
i.e., the functionality of each ABCI application is separated into multiple modules, like the approach adopted by [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/beginner/app-anatomy#modules).

- **CCV Module**: The module that implements the CCV protocol. Both the provider and the consumer chains have each their own CCV module. 
Furthermore, the functionalities provided by the CCV module differ between the provider chain and the consumer chains. 
For brevity, we use *provider CCV module* and *consumer CCV module* to refer to the CCV modules on the provider chain and on the consumer chains, respectively. 

- **CCV Channel**: A unique, ordered IBC channel that is used by the provider CCV module to exchange IBC packets with a consumer CCV module. 
Note that there is a separate CCV channel for every consumer chain.

The IBC handler interface, the IBC relayer module interface, and both IBC channels and IBC packets are as defined in [ICS 25](../../core/ics-025-handler-interface), [ICS 26](../../core/ics-026-routing-module), and [ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics), respectively.

- **Validator Set Change (VSC)**: A change in the validator set of the provider chain that must be reflected in the validator sets of the consumer chains. 
Every VSC consists of a batch of validator updates provided to the consensus engine of the provider chain. 

> **Background**: In the context of single-chain validation, the changes of the validator set are triggered by the *Staking module*, 
> i.e., a module of the ABCI application that implements the proof of stake mechanism needed by the [security model](#security-model). 
> For an example, take a look at the [Staking module documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/staking) of Cosmos SDK.

Some of the validator updates can decrease the voting power granted to validators. 
These decreases may be a consequence of unbonding operations (e.g., unbonding delegations) on the provider chain.
which MUST NOT complete before reaching maturity on both the provider and all the consumer chains,
i.e., the *unbonding period* (denoted as `UnbondingPeriod`) has elapsed on both the provider and all the consumer chains.
Thus, a *VSC reaching maturity* on a consumer chain means that all the unbonding operations that resulted in validator updates included in that VSC have matured on the consumer chain.

> **Background**: An *unbonding operation* is any operation of unbonding an amount of the tokens a validator bonded. Note that the bonded tokens correspond to the validator's voting power. We distinguish between three types of unbonding operations:
>
> - *undelegation* - a delegator unbonds tokens it previously delegated to a validator;
> - *redelegation* - a delegator instantly redelegates tokens from a source validator to a different validator (the destination validator);
> - *validator unbonding* - a validator is removed from the validator set; note that although validator unbondings do not entail unbonding tokens, they behave similarly to other unbonding operations.
> 
> Regardless of the type, unbonding operations have two components: 
>
> - The *initiation*, e.g., a delegator requests their delegated tokens to be unbonded. The initiation of an operation of unbonding an amount of the tokens a validator bonded results in a change in the voting power of that validator.
> - The *completion*, e.g., the tokens are actually unbonded and transferred back to the delegator. To complete, unbonding operations must reach *maturity*, i.e., `UnbondingPeriod` must elapse since the operations were initiated. 
> 
> For more details, take a look at the [Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/staking).
>
> **Note**: Time periods are measured in terms of the block time, i.e., `currentTimestamp()` (as defined in [ICS 24](../../core/ics-024-host-requirements)). 
> As a result, a consumer chain MAY start the unbonding period for every VSC that it applies in a block at any point during that block.

- **Slash Request**: A request by a consumer chain to *slash* the tokens bonded by a validator on the provider chain as a consequence of that validator misbehavior on the consumer chain. A slash request MAY also result in the misbehaving validator being *jailed* for a period of time, during which it cannot be part of the validator set. 

> **Background**: In the context of single-chain validation, slashing and jailing misbehaving validators is handled by the *Slashing module*, 
> i.e., a module of the ABCI application that enables the application to discourage misbehaving validators.
> For an example, take a look at the [Slashing module documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/slashing) of Cosmos SDK.

## Overview

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

CCV must handle the following types of operations:

- **Channel Initialization**: Create unique, ordered IBC channels between the provider chain and every consumer chain.
- **Validator Set Update**: It is a two-part operation, i.e., 
  - update the validator sets of all the consumer chains based on the information obtained from the *provider Staking module* (i.e., the Staking module on the provider chain) on the amount of tokens bonded by validators on the provider chain;
  - and enable the timely completion (cf. the unbonding periods on the consumer chains) of unbonding operations (i.e., operations of unbonding bonded tokens).
- **Consumer Initiated Slashing**: Enable the provider chain to slash and jail bonded validators that misbehave while validating on the consumer chain.
- **Reward Distribution**: Enable the distribution of block production rewards and transaction fees from the consumer chains to the validators on the provider chain.  

### Channel Initialization

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

The CCV Channel initialization differentiates between chains that start directly as consumer chains and existing chains that transition to consumer chains.
In both cases, consumer chains are created through governance proposals. For an example of how governance proposals work, take a look at the [Governance module documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/gov) of Cosmos SDK.

#### Channel Initialization: New Chains

The following figure shows an overview of the CCV Channel initialization for new chains. 

![Channel Initialization Overview: New Chain](./figures/ccv-init-overview.png?raw=true)

The channel initialization for new chains consists of three phases:

- **Create clients**: Once the provider CCV module receives a proposal to add a new consumer chain with an empty connection ID, it creates a client of the consumer chain (as defined in [ICS 2](../../core/ics-002-client-semantics)) and a genesis state of the consumer CCV module. 
  Then, the operators of validators in the validator set of the provider chain must each query the provider for the CCV genesis state and start a validator node of the consumer chain. 
  Once the consumer chain starts, the application receives an `InitChain` message from the consensus engine 
  (for more details, take a look at the [ABCI specification](https://github.com/tendermint/spec/blob/v0.7.1/spec/abci/abci.md#initchain)). 
  The `InitChain` message triggers the call to the `InitGenesis()` method of the consumer CCV module, which creates a client of the provider chain.
  For client creation, both a `ClientState` and a `ConsensusState` are necessary (as defined in [ICS 2](../../core/ics-002-client-semantics));
  both are contained in the genesis state of the consumer CCV module.
  The genesis state is distributed to all operators that need to start a full node of the consumer chain 
  (the mechanism of distributing the genesis state is outside the scope of this specification).
  Finally, the consumer CCV module initiates both the connection handshake (as defined in [ICS 3](../../core/ics-003-connection-semantics)) and the channel handshake (as defined in [ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics)).
  > Note that at genesis, the validator set of the consumer chain matches the validator set of the provider chain.
- **Connection handshake**: A relayer (as defined in [ICS 18](../../relayer/ics-018-relayer-algorithms)) is responsible for completing the connection handshake (as defined in [ICS 3](../../core/ics-003-connection-semantics)). 
- **Channel handshake**: A relayer is responsible for completing the channel handshake (as defined in [ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics)).
  The handshake consists of four messages that need to be received for a channel built on top of the expected clients. 
  Note that the channel handshake is initiated on the consumer chain. 
  - *OnChanOpenInit*: On receiving a `ChanOpenInit` message, the consumer CCV module verifies that the underlying client associated with this channel is the expected client of the provider chain (i.e., created during genesis).
  - *OnChanOpenTry*: On receiving a `ChanOpenTry` message, the provider CCV module verifies that the underlying client associated with this channel is the expected client of the consumer chain (i.e., created when handling the governance proposal).
  - *OnChanOpenAck*: On receiving the *FIRST* `ChanOpenAck` message, the consumer CCV module considers its side of the CCV channel to be established.
  Also, if a transfer channel ID was not provided in the governance proposal, the consumer CCV module initiates the opening handshake for the token transfer channel required by the Reward Distribution operation (see the [Reward Distribution](#reward-distribution) section).
  - *OnChanOpenConfirm*: On receiving the *FIRST* `ChanOpenConfirm` message, the provider CCV module considers its side of the CCV channel to be established.

#### Channel Initialization: Existing Chains

The following figure shows an overview of the CCV Channel initialization for existing chains. 

![Channel Initialization Overview: Existing Chain](./figures/ccv-preccv-init-overview.png?raw=true)

The channel initialization for existing chains consists of three phases:

- **Start consumer CCV module**: Once the provider CCV module receives a proposal to add a new consumer chain with a valid *connection ID*, it creates a genesis state of the consumer CCV module.
  Then, the existing chain must upgrade by adding the consumer CCV module and  initialize it using the CCV genesis state created by the provider.
  Once the consumer CCV module starts, it initiates the channel handshake (as defined in [ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics)).

- **Channel handshake**: A relayer is responsible for completing the channel handshake (as defined in [ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics)).
  The handshake consists of four messages that need to be received for a channel built on top of the expected clients (i.e., the clients used by the connection provided in the governance proposal). 
  Note that the channel handshake is initiated on the consumer chain. 
  - *OnChanOpenInit*: On receiving a `ChanOpenInit` message, the consumer CCV module verifies that the underlying client associated with this channel is the expected client of the provider chain.
  - *OnChanOpenTry*: On receiving a `ChanOpenTry` message, the provider CCV module verifies that the underlying client associated with this channel is the expected client of the consumer chain.
  - *OnChanOpenAck*: On receiving the *FIRST* `ChanOpenAck` message, the consumer CCV module considers its side of the CCV channel to be established.
  Also, if a transfer channel ID was not provided in the governance proposal, the consumer CCV module initiates the opening handshake for the token transfer channel required by the Reward Distribution operation (see the [Reward Distribution](#reward-distribution) section).
  Finally, the consumer CCV module makes a requests to the Staking module of the existing chain to replace its validator set with the initial validator set from the CCV genesis state created by the provider.
    > Note that this is the same as the provider validator set when the governance proposal was handled.
  - *OnChanOpenConfirm*: On receiving the *FIRST* `ChanOpenConfirm` message, the provider CCV module considers its side of the CCV channel to be established.

- **Transition to consumer chain**: Once the validator set on the existing chain is replace by the initial validator set (from the CCV genesis state created by the provider), the existing chain becomes a consumer chain.

> **Note**: For both new and existing chains, as long as the [assumptions required by CCV](./system_model_and_properties.md#assumptions) hold (e.g., *Correct Relayer*), every governance proposal to spawn a new consumer chain that passes on the provider chain results eventually in a CCV channel being created. 
> Furthermore, the "*FIRST*" keyword in the above description ensures the uniqueness of the CCV channel, i.e., all subsequent attempts to create another CCV channel to the same consumer chain will fail.
>
> **Note**: For both new and existing chains, until the CCV channel is established, the initial validator set of the consumer chain cannot be updated (see the [Validator Set Update](#validator-set-update) section) and the validators from this initial set cannot be slashed (see the [Consumer Initiated Slashing](#consumer-initiated-slashing) section).
> This means that the consumer chain is *not yet secured* by the provider chain.
> Thus, to reduce the attack surface during channel initialization, the consumer chain SHOULD enable user transactions only after the CCV channel is established (i.e., after receiving the first VSC). 
> As a consequence, a malicious initial validator set can only influence the initialization of the CCV channel. 

For a more detailed description of Channel Initialization, take a look at the [technical specification](./methods.md#initialization).

### Validator Set Update

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

In the context of VSCs, the CCV module enables the following functionalities:

- On the provider chain, 
  - **provide** VSCs to the consumer chains, for them to update their validator sets according to the validator set of the provider chain; 
      providing VSCs entails sending `VSCPacket`s to all consumer chains;  
  - **register** VSC maturity notifications from the consumer chain.
- On every consumer chain,
  - **apply** the VSCs provided by the provider chain to the validator set of the consumer chain; 
  - **notify** the provider chain that the provided VSCs have matured on this consumer chain; 
      notifying of VSCs maturity entails sending `VSCMaturedPacket`s to the provider chain.

These functionalities are depicted in the following figure that shows an overview of the Validator Set Update operation of CCV. 
For a more detailed description of Validator Set Update, take a look at the [technical specification](./methods.md#validator-set-update).

![Validator Set Update Overview](./figures/ccv-vsc-overview.png?raw=true)

#### Completion of Unbonding Operations

In the context of single-chain validation, the completion of any unbonding operation requires the `UnbondingPeriod` to elapse since the operations was initiated (i.e., the operation MUST reach maturity). 
In the context of CCV, the completion MUST require also the unbonding operation to reach maturity on **all** consumer chains (for the [Security Model](#security-model) to be preserved). 
Therefore, the provider Staking module needs to be aware of the VSC maturity notifications registered by the provider CCV module.

The ***provider chain*** achieves this through the following approach: 

- The Staking module is notifying the CCV module when any unbonding operation is initiated. 
  As a result, the CCV module maps all the unbonding operations to the corresponding VSCs.  
- When the CCV module registers maturity notifications for a VSC from all consumer chains, it notifies the Staking module of the maturity of all unbonding operations mapped to this VSC. 
  This enables the Staking module to complete the unbonding operations only when they reach maturity on both the provider chain and on all the consumer chains.

This approach is depicted in the following figure that shows an overview of the interface between the provider CCV module and the provider Staking module in the context of the Validator Set Update operation of CCV: 

- In `Block 1`, two unbonding operations are initiated (i.e., `undelegate-1` and `redelegate-1`) in the provider Staking module. 
  For each operation, the provider Staking module notifies the provider CCV module. 
  As a result, the provider CCV module maps these to operation to `vscId`, which is the ID of the following VSC (i.e., `VSC1`). 
  The provider CCV module provides `VSC1` to all consumer chains.
- In `Block 2`, the same approach is used for `undelegate-2`.
- In `Block j`, `UnbondingPeriod` has elapsed since `Block 1`. 
  In the meantime, the provider CCV module registered maturity notifications for `VSC1` from all consumer chains 
  and, consequently, notified the provider Staking module of the maturity of both `undelegate-1` and `redelegate-1`. 
  As a result, the provider Staking module completes both unbonding operations in `Block j`.
- In `Block k`, `UnbondingPeriod` has elapsed since `Block 2`. 
  In the meantime, the provider CCV module has NOT yet registered maturity notifications for `VSC2` from all consumer chains. 
  As a result, the provider Staking module CANNOT complete `undelegate-2` in `Block k`. 
  The unbonding operation is completed later once the provider CCV module registered maturity notifications for `VSC2` from all consumer chains.

![Completion of Unbonding Operations](./figures/ccv-unbonding-overview.png?raw=true)

### Consumer Initiated Slashing

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

For the [Security Model](#security-model) to be preserved, misbehaving validators MUST be slashed (and MAY be jailed, i.e., removed from the validator set). 
A prerequisite to slashing validators is to receive valid evidence of their misbehavior. 
Thus, when slashing a validator, we distinguish between three events and the heights when they occur:

- `infractionHeight`, the height at which the misbehavior (or infraction) happened;
- `evidenceHeight`, the height at which the evidence of misbehavior is received;
- `slashingHeight`, the height at which the validator is slashed (and jailed). 

> **Note**: In the context of single-chain validation, usually `evidenceHeight = slashingHeight`. 

The [Security Model](#security-model) guarantees that any misbehaving validator can be slashed for at least the unbonding period, 
i.e., as long as that validator's tokens are not unbonded yet, they can be slashed. 
However, if the tokens start unbonding before `infractionHeight` (i.e., the tokens did not contribute to the voting power that committed the infraction) then the tokens MUST NOT be slashed.

In the context of CCV, validators (with tokens bonded on the provider chain) MUST be slashed for infractions committed on the consumer chains at heights for which they have voting power. 
Thus, although the infractions are committed on the consumer chains and evidence of these infractions is submitted to the consumer chains, the slashing happens on the provider chain. As a result, the Consumer Initiated Slashing operation requires, for every consumer chain, a mapping from consumer chain block heights to provider chain block heights.

The following figure shows the intuition behind such a mapping using the provided VSCs. 
The four unbonding operations (i.e., undelegations) occur on the provider chain and, as a consequence, the provider chain provides VSCs to the consumer chain, e.g., `undelegate-3` results in `VSC3` being provided.
The four colors (i.e., red, blue, green, and yellow) indicate the mapping of consumer chain heights to provider chain heights. 
Note that on the provider chain there is only one block of a given color. 
Also, note that the three white blocks between the green and the yellow blocks on the provider chain have the same validator set.  
As a result, a validator misbehaving on the consumer chain, e.g., in either of the two green blocks, is slashed the same as if misbehaving on the provider chain, e.g., in the green block. 
This ensures that once unbonding operations are initiated, the corresponding unbonding tokens are not slashed for infractions committed in the subsequent blocks, e.g., the tokens unbonding due to `undelegate-3` are not slashed for infractions committed in or after the green blocks.

![Intuition of Mapping Between Provider and Consumer Heights](./figures/ccv-mapping-intuition.png?raw=true)

The following figure shows describes how CCV creates the mapping from consumer chain heights to provider chain heights.
For clarity, we use `Hp*` and `Hc*` to denote block heights on the provider chain and consumer chain, respectively. 

![Mapping Between Provider and Consumer Heights](./figures/ccv-height-mapping-overview.png?raw=true)

- For every block, the provider CCV module maps the ID of the VSC it provides to the consumer chains to the height of the subsequent block, i.e., `VSCtoH[VSC.id] = Hp + 1`, for a VSC provided at height `Hp`. 
  Intuitively, this means that the validator updates in a provided VSC will update the voting power at height `VSCtoH[VSC.id]`.
- For every block, every consumer CCV module maps the height of the subsequent block to the ID of the latest received VSC, e.g., `HtoVSC[Hc2 + 1] = VSC1.id`. 
  Intuitively, this means that the voting power on the consumer chain during a block `Hc` was updated by the VSC with ID `HtoVSC[Hc]`.
  > **Note**: It is possible for multiple VSCs to be received by the consumer chain within the same block. For more details, take a look at the [Validator sets, validator updates and VSCs](./system_model_and_properties.md#validator-sets-validator-updates-and-vscs) section.
- By default, every consumer CCV module maps any block height to `0` (i.e., VSC IDs start from `1`). 
  Intuitively, this means that the voting power on the consumer chain at height `Hc` with `HtoVSC(Hc) = 0` was setup at genesis during Channel Initialization. 
- For every consumer chain, the provider CCV module sets `VSCtoH[0]` to the height when it establishes the CCV channel to this consumer chain. 
  Note that the validator set on the provider chain at height `VSCtoH[0]` matches the validator set at the height when the first VSC is provided to this consumer chain. 
  This means that this validator set on the provider chain matches the validator set on the consumer chain at all heights `Hc` with `HtoVSC[Hc] = 0`.

The following figure shows an overview of the Consumer Initiated Slashing operation of CCV. 

![Consumer Initiated Slashing](./figures/ccv-evidence-overview.png?raw=true)

- At (evidence) height `Hc2`, the consumer chain receives evidence that a validator `V` misbehaved at (infraction) height `Hc1`. 
  As a result, the consumer CCV module sends a `SlashPacket` to the provider chain: 
  It makes a request to slash `V`, but it replaces the infraction height `Hc1` with `HtoVSC[Hc1]`, 
  i.e., the ID of the VSC that updated the "misbehaving voting power" or `0` if such a VSC does not exist.
- The provider CCV module receives at (slashing) height `Hp1` the `SlashPacket` with `vscId = HtoVSC[Hc1]`. 
  As a result, it requests the provider Slashing module to slash `V`, but it set the infraction height to `VSCtoH[vscId]`, i.e., 
  - if `vscId != 0`, the height on the provider chain where the voting power was updated by the VSC with ID `vscId`;
  - otherwise, the height at which the CCV channel to this consumer chain was established.
  > **Note**: As a consequence of slashing (and potentially jailing) `V`, the Staking module updates accordingly `V`'s voting power. This update MUST be visible in the next VSC provided to the consumer chains.  

For a more detailed description of Consumer Initiated Slashing, take a look at the [technical specification](./methods.md#consumer-initiated-slashing).

### Reward Distribution

[&uparrow; Back to Outline](#outline)

In the context of single-chain validation, the *Distribution module*, i.e., a module of the ABCI application, handles the distribution of rewards (i.e., block production rewards and transaction fees) to every validator account based on their total voting power; 
these rewards are then further distributed to the delegators. 
For an example, take a look at the [Distribution module documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/distribution) of Cosmos SDK.

At the beginning of every block, the rewards for the previous block are pooled into a distribution module account. 
The Reward Distribution operation of CCV enables every consumer chain to transfer a fraction of these rewards to the provider chain. 
The operation consists of two steps that are depicted in the following figure:

![Reward Distribution](./figures/ccv-distribution-overview.png?raw=true)

- At the beginning of every block on the consumer chain, a fraction of the rewards are transferred to an account on the consumer CCV module.
- At regular intervals (e.g., every `1000` blocks), the consumer CCV module sends the accumulated rewards to the distribution module account on the provider chain through an IBC token transfer packet (as defined in [ICS 20](../ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md)). 
  Note that the IBC transfer packet is sent over a separate unordered channel. 
  As a result, the reward distribution is not synchronized with the other CCV operations,
  e.g., some validators may miss out on some rewards by unbonding before an IBC transfer packet is received, 
  while other validators may get some extra rewards by bonding before an IBC transfer packet is received.

> **Note**: From the perspective of the distribution module account on the provider chain, the rewards coming from the consumer chains are indistinguishable  from locally collected rewards and thus, are distributed to all the validators and their delegators.

As a prerequisite of this approach, every consumer chain must open a token transfer channel to the provider chain and be made aware of the address of the distribution module account on the provider chain, both of which happen during channel initialization.

- On receiving a `ChanOpenAck` message, the consumer CCV module initiates the opening handshake for the token transfer channel using the same client and connection as for the CCV channel. 
- On receiving a `ChanOpenTry` message, the provider CCV module adds the address of the distribution module account to the channel version as metadata (as defined in [ICS 4](../../core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics/README.md#definitions)).
