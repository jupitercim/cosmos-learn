The original idea of IBC was first outlined in the Cosmos whitepaper [@cosmos_whitepaper], and realisation of the protocol is made possible in practice by the Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus and efficient light client verification of Tendermint, introduced in *Tendermint: Consensus without Mining* [@tendermint_consensus_without_mining] and updated in *The latest gossip on BFT consensus* [@tendermint_latest_gossip]. An earlier version of the IBC specification [@ethan_frey_ibc_spec] was written by Ethan Frey.

Many current and former employees of All in Bits (dba Tendermint Inc.), Agoric Systems, the Interchain Foundation, Informal Systems, and Interchain GmbH participated in brainstorming and reviews of the IBC protocol. Thanks are due in particular to Ethan Buchman, Jae Kwon, Ethan Frey, Juwoon Yun, Anca Zamfir, Zarko Milosevic, Zaki Manian, Aditya Sripal, Federico Kunze, Dean Tribble, Mark Miller, Brian Warner, Chris Hibbert, Michael FIG, Sunny Aggarwal, Dev Ojha, Colin Axner, and Jack Zampolin. Thanks also to Meher Roy at Chorus One. Thanks to Zaki Manian, Sam Hart, and Adi Seredinschi for reviewing this paper.
