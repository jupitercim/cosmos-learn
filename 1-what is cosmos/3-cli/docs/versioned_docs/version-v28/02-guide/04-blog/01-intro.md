# In-depth blog tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a blog application as a Cosmos
SDK blockchain using the Ignite CLI by building it from scratch. This means that
you will be responsible for setting up the necessary types, messages, and
queries and writing the logic to create, read, update, and delete blog posts on
the blockchain.

The functionality of the application you will be building will be identical to
what is generated by the Ignite CLI command `ignite scaffold list post title
body`, but you will be doing it manually in order to gain a deeper understanding
of the process. Through this tutorial, you will learn how to build a blog
application on a Cosmos SDK blockchain using the Ignite CLI in a hands-on way.
